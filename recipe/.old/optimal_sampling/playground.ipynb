      "Okay, so I need to figure out how much money you save by buying the appliance from the TV advertiser instead of buying it in-store. The in-store price is $99.99, and the TV deal is three payments of $29.98 each plus a one-time shipping and handling charge of $9.98. I need to find the difference between these two amounts and convert it to cents. Let me break this down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me calculate the total cost from the TV advertiser. They have three payments of $29.98. So, I need to multiply 29.98 by 3. Let me do that:\n",
      "\n",
      "29.98 * 3. Hmm, 29.98 is almost 30, so 30 * 3 is 90. But since it's 29.98, which is 0.02 less than 30, I need to subtract 0.02 * 3 from 90. That would be 90 - 0.06 = 89.94. So, the total of the three payments is $89.94.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's a one-time shipping and handling charge of $9.98. So, I need to add that to the total of the payments. Let me add 89.94 and 9.98. Let me do that:\n",
      "\n",
      "89.94 + 9.98. Adding the cents first: 94 cents + 98 cents is 192 cents, which is $1.92. Then the dollars: 89 + 9 = 98. So, 98 + 1.92 = $99.92. Wait, let me check that again. 89.94 + 9.98.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can think of it as 89.94 + 10.00 = 99.94, but since it's 9.98, which is 2 cents less than 10.00, so subtract 0.02 from 99.94. That gives 99.94 - 0.02 = 99.92. Yes, so the total cost from the TV advertiser is $99.92.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the in-store price is $99.99. So, how much is saved? The difference between the in-store price and the TV price. So, 99.99 - 99.92. Let me calculate that.\n",
      "\n",
      "99.99 minus 99.92. Subtracting the dollars: 99 - 99 = 0. Subtracting the cents: 99 cents - 92 cents = 7 cents. So, the total savings is 7 cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that seems really small. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, total of three payments: 29.98 * 3. Let me do it more carefully:\n",
      "\n",
      "29.98 * 3. 20*3=60, 9*3=27, 0.98*3=2.94. So, adding those up: 60 + 27 = 87, plus 2.94 is 89.94. So that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then adding the shipping and handling: 89.94 + 9.98. Let me add them:\n",
      "\n",
      "89.94 + 9.98. Let me write it vertically:\n",
      "\n",
      "  89.94\n",
      "+  9.98\n",
      "--------\n",
      "  99.92\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's correct. 89 + 9 is 98, 0.94 + 0.98 is 1.92, so total is 99.92. So, the TV total is $99.92.\n",
      "\n",
      "In-store is $99.99. So, 99.99 - 99.92 = 0.07, which is 7 cents. So, the savings is 7 cents. That seems correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I feel like 7 cents is a very small amount. Maybe I miscalculated the total from the TV advertiser? Let me check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three payments of $29.98: 29.98 * 3. Let me do 29.98 * 2 = 59.96, then add another 29.98: 59.96 + 29.98. 59 + 29 = 88, 0.96 + 0.98 = 1.94, so total is 89.94. Then add 9.98: 89.94 + 9.98.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, 89.94 + 9.98: 89 + 9 = 98, 0.94 + 0.98 = 1.92, so 98 + 1.92 = 99.92. So that's right.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the in-store is 99.99. So, 99.99 - 99.92 = 0.07. Yes, that's 7 cents. So, the answer is 7 cents. Maybe the problem is designed to show that even though there are multiple payments, the total is slightly less, so you save 7 cents. \n",
      "\n",
      "But just to be thorough, let me check if the shipping and handling is included in the total. The problem says \"three easy payments of $29.98 and a one-time shipping and handling charge of $9.98\". So, the total is indeed 3*29.98 + 9.98. Which is 89.94 + 9.98 = 99.92. So, yes, the total is $99.92. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the difference is 99.99 - 99.92 = 0.07, which is 7 cents. Therefore, the answer is 7 cents. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the question says \"how many cents are saved by buying the appliance from the television advertiser?\" So, the amount saved is 7 cents. \n",
      "\n",
      "But just to make sure there's no trick here. Maybe the payments are not all paid upfront? But the problem says \"three easy payments of $29.98\", so that's the total amount paid. So, you pay 29.98 three times, and then the shipping and handling. So, total is 3*29.98 + 9.98. So, no, that's all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the question is about the total amount paid over time versus the in-store price. But the question is about total cost. So, regardless of when you pay, the total cost is 99.92 for the TV ad. So, compared to 99.99, the saving is 7 cents. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think the answer is 7 cents. \n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check with another approach. Let me convert all amounts to cents to avoid decimal confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In-store price: $99.99 is 9999 cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "TV advertiser: three payments of $29.98 each. $29.98 is 2998 cents. So, 2998 * 3 = ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me compute 2998 * 3:\n",
      "\n",
      "2000 * 3 = 6000\n",
      "\n",
      "900 * 3 = 2700\n",
      "\n",
      "98 * 3 = 294\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding them up: 6000 + 2700 = 8700 + 294 = 8994 cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then add the shipping and handling charge of $9.98, which is 998 cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total from TV advertiser: 8994 + 998 = ?\n",
      "\n",
      "8994 + 998. Let me compute 8994 + 1000 = 9994, then subtract 2: 9994 - 2 = 9992 cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In-store price is 9999 cents. So, the difference is 9999 - 9992 = 7 cents. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! So, 7 cents. Therefore, the answer is 7 cents. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think this confirms my previous calculation. Therefore, the amount saved is 7 cents. \n",
      "\n",
      "But just to make sure, let me check the conversion again:\n",
      "\n",
      "$29.98 is 29 dollars and 98 cents. So, 29*100 + 98 = 2900 + 98 = 2998 cents. Correct. \n",
      "\n",
      "Three payments: 2998 * 3 = 8994 cents. Correct. \n",
      "\n",
      "Shipping and handling: $9.98 is 9 dollars and 98 cents. 9*100 + 98 = 900 + 98 = 998 cents. Correct. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In-store: $99.99 is 99*100 + 99 = 9900 + 99 = 9999 cents. Correct. \n",
      "\n",
      "Difference: 9999 - 9992 = 7 cents. Yes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is 7 cents. \n",
